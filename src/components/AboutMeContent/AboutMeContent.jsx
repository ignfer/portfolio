          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have tackled a variety of areas, making myself <strong>a developer 
            capable of carrying out end-to-end development. </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I&apos;m comfortable and I have experience <strong>creating responsive UI&apos;s 
            , creating my own styles</strong>, planning <strong>the frontend&apos;s layout from scratch</strong>
            or <strong>replicating a design into a real and functional prototype or project. </strong>
            Also I have experience <strong>creating a backend</strong> able to achieve the 
            <strong>business logic needed</strong>, I&apos;ve worked for years with 
            a heavily <strong>OOP focus</strong>, and also I&apos;m experienced on
            working with <strong>REST or SOAP APIs.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I enjoy taking on projects beyond my current abilities because I believe <strong>they are the ones 
            that offer the greatest progress.</strong>
