# Unify to diversify

By [Ignacio Fernández](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciofern%C3%A1ndez/) | Last modified: 07-08-2025

I enjoy creating and expanding the reach of my own personal brand. However, after doing it for a while you may realize that you have different versions of yourself, information that represents "more or less" the same thing, but in different languages, or with different levels of detail, focus or approach.

For example:

- Github profile
- LinkedIn profile
- Personal website
- Resume

Try being creative in one of these, just to remember a few days later that your Github and LinkedIn profiles are not aligned with your personal website, or that your resume is not aligned with any of them.

As a developer, even if you enjoy creating content as much as I do, the goal must be clear: create a maintainable and scalable content strategy.

After all, I'am not a content creator, I am a developer, and I want to focus on what I do best: creating software.

## Unify

### Forget DRY

In the world of software development, we often hear about the DRY principle: "Don't Repeat Yourself". However, when it comes to personal branding and content creation, this principle can lead to confusion and inconsistency. Instead, I propose a different approach: unify your content.

This means that you should have a single source of truth for your personal brand. This could be your personal website, or a specific platform where you feel most comfortable.
Dont worry on being unique in each platform, repeat if you have to, but make sure that the content is consistent across all platforms.

### Create concise content

In the age of LLMs and AI, we must drift away from long, verbose content. Instead, focus on creating concise, impactful content that can be easily understood and shared. Now more than ever, people appreciate brevity and clarity.
