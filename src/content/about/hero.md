title: About Ignacio FernÃ¡ndez
---

Hi! I am [Ignacio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciofern%C3%A1ndez/), a 23 years old software developer residing in Uruguay and my [motto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto)
is [this](https://world.hey.com/dhh/it-must-be-worth-it-even-if-it-doesn-t-work-1e7f49fc)
> It must be worth it even if it doesn't work

I've been working full time since April 2024 as a fullstack developer at [Cargonet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/austral-cargo/posts/?feedView=all), an Uruguayan Freight
Forwarder agent. When I first started I had no idea about what a freight forwarder was but I loved the challenge as much as the opportunity.

Since then, I've been working in a small team with great people within a fast-paced environment, this job allowed me to build my trust as a developer with real world experience, I
am
lucky of being
able to build software that solves real problems, and experience deploying a feature in the evening and getting feedback from the end users during lunch.

I've tackled a wide range of problems in every stage of my career here, so taking into consideration [this great article](https://basecamp.com/handbook/titles-for-programmers) as a
guide, here is how I grew at [Cargonet](https://www.linkedin.com/company/austral-cargo/posts/?feedView=all)

- ### 0 to 3 months, frontend mobile development

During this stage, I started writing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), for a sales-focused application, replicating already existent logic into more
niche
approach, less features but high research around the React native ecosystem. I've also proposed simple solutions for brand identity needs using [figma](https://figma.com).

_**Occasional issues following patterns and approaches within existing code bases, routine and tightly-scoped problems, required regular guidance and a somewhere straight-forward
path to follow.**_,

- ### 3 to 9 months, frontend web development, figma UI prototyping, AI research and implementation

Here I've started writing code for the main internal-use tool, focusing on [React](https://react.dev/) and managing bug-fixes in the legacy codebase. I was the main responsible of
improving and
refactoring the overall look
and feel of the tool, mostly css-focused changes. Aiming for a more modern and professional look I've created an unified style and certain guidelines to make it easier in a future
to develop new features.

I've also was responsible of translating team ideas into a dynamic figma prototype which was the blueprint to our dashboard. Once the prototype was finished, I've developed the
dashboard's frontend using mostly [mantine](https://mantine.dev/) and [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/charts/area).

We also take a few weeks to research about possible implementations using [langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and third-party LLM's providers such as [groq](https://groq.com/),
creating functional proof of concepts

At the end of this period I was confidently and recurringly able to identify and apply improvements to the existing codebase, even in the code that I wrote when I just started.

_**May require oversight from senior peers. Prioritizes tasks and project work with little direction. Works confidently and effectively, persists when faced with uncertainty or
ambiguity but pulls in support when
needed. Follows established patterns and approaches within existing code bases with ease, Capable of working on clearly defined and scoped individual features or problems. Work is
reviewed with some back and forth. Makes contributions to documentation**_,

- ### 9 to 18 months, fullstack development and customer support (Current)

Given the knowledge that I gathered during this time, I was able to start solving user problems and incidence, off-loading work load from my
team. So we were in need of a way to sort and handle support tickets, once again I was in charge of creating a new service from scratch to allow users to easily create tickets and
suggest improvements to the development team.
Here I had the opportunity to apply all my frontend knowledge to a new backoffice frontend, also I was able to learn from my peers in how to build a microservice
with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

I've also started to define and push a more clear way to solve problems given previous experience, for example if I'm faced with a new endpoint I would currently take the following
approach:

- If the state is complex enough or if it needs to be easily shared or persisted client-side, go for [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- Define schemas and run validations using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- Using the needed endpoints, create and easily reuse queries or mutations using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

After the [news](https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app) I take action into migrating our app to [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
