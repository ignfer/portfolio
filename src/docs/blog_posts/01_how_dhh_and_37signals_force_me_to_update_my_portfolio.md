*In this entry, I will talk you through that time in which [DHH](https://x.com/dhh)
and [37signals](https://37signals.com/) team forced me to change my entire portfolio.*

Now, seriously, this article is a recap of how [this](https://apply.workable.com/37signals/j/A97E298621/) job offer
and [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221_junior-rails-programmer-37signals-activity-7315314289219706881-Kv-w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAClJnbEBH4QPy9OzpMPGilPUGiKgzuhV-aI)
post reminded me how easy is to get lost in the comfort zone even when you know that you could do better and how unforgivable time is about it. I started to work on this
application too late, but it was a very funny and encouragin experience anyways.

### When a Junior Engineer has no mentorship

![Post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignfer/portfolio/refs/heads/main/public/assets/images/8409678f-e53f-45f4-ade0-04c17f3680c8.webp)

I would like to start mentioning this post where I interacted with Daniel, I find quite useful to
point [this interaction](https://x.com/sinksa_/status/1907090917577662858) given the following 2 things

* It happened previous to the job offer, so I think is very clear that it was a true and genuine question.

* Is like a snapshot of my current situation as a developer within a small team, **there is no seniors, we have to research everything,** and yes, that comes with benefits like
  learning at an accelerated peace, but being able to have someone available to perform these type of interactions would be a very important leverage for my career as a software
  engineer, having someone to ask from time to time stuff like 'Hey, what should I use to fix this?' or 'Should I use X or Y solution' or to simply talk about possible solutions
  or new ideas.

In my current work I had the valuable chance of interviewing people for a software engineer role, one of the questions that I've asked in every single interview was "Any particular
technology or business that you discovered recently?" It could be anything, there was no incorrect or expected answer, most of the responses were quite vague, and I find that very
interesting.

Maybe is because hoy my day to day is structured but I am constantly reading and hearing from new technologies, there is so much to try and so much to learn, and that is a bless,
but again, having someone to guide me, or the current lack of that, is a topic that every day takes a bigger and bigger toss on my priority list.

I think that's one of the most important things any new developer can find in any solid, large team made up of dedicated people. If you make the effort to maintain the level, even
if you'll likely fall short of the goal every day, the pace of progress will be dramatically accelerated by a situation like this.

### Urgency

*Maybe it sounds a little harsh, but a programmer who's been working professionally for five years has likely already revealed their potential. What you're going to get is roughly
what you see. That doesn't mean that people can't get better after that, but it means that the trajectory by which they improve has already been plotted.*

I think David it's right, it sounds a little *too* harsh, but I think I understand, at least, as much as my one year of experience working as a developer allow me to

Was when I read about the position that I started questioning myself, _what did I built in this past time?_, I mean, professionally in my work, a lot of things! NDA protected
things,
so that wouldn't do

I had to go back and search in previous work, not ideas, not prototypes, actual stuff that I have built, so I went back to my portfolio.

In that moment, I realized how little did I built outside from work, I started refactoring everything on my portfolio but as I said before, I didn't have that much time, so I could
barely snap together a markdown parser, move away from yarn to npm and write this entry.

I am pretty sure that with an offer built to target the top 10% salaries in SF, a few commits fixing things wouldn't be able to keep up, but **thanks to this offer, I've gained
such agency and urgency-like feeling that I think is very valuable to build momentum, and keep building solutions, real, open source solutions, to be able to show and share in the
future.**

To whoever is reading this, have a nice day! ðŸ«¡
