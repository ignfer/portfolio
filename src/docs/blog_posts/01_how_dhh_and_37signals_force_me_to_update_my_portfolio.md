`` Created at: 4/21/2025 | Estimated duration: 7 minutes ``

*In this entry, I will talk you through that time in which [DHH](https://x.com/dhh)
and [37signals](https://37signals.com/) team forced me to change my entire portfolio.*

Now, seriously, this article is a recap of how [this](https://apply.workable.com/37signals/j/A97E298621/) job offer
and [this](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221_junior-rails-programmer-37signals-activity-7315314289219706881-Kv-w?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAClJnbEBH4QPy9OzpMPGilPUGiKgzuhV-aI)
post reminded me how easy is to get lost in the comfort zone even when you know that you could do better and how unforgivable time is about it.

### When a Junior Engineer has no mentorship

As an end note concluding this post, I find very funny to point [this interaction](https://x.com/sinksa_/status/1907090917577662858)
that I had with Daniel in X, Is useful for me given the following 2 points

1. It happened previous to the job offer, so I think is very clear that it was a true and genuine question.
2. Is like a snapshot of my current situation as a developer within a small team, there is no seniors, we have to research everything, and yes, that comes with benefits like
   learning at an accelerated peace, but being able to ask from time to time stuff like 'Hey, what should I use to fix this?' or 'Should I use X or Y solution'

### The known factor

*Maybe it sounds a little harsh, but a programmer who's been working professionally for five years has likely already revealed their potential. What you're going to get is roughly
what you see. That doesn't mean that people can't get better after that, but it means that the trajectory by which they improve has already been plotted.*

I think David it's right, it sounds a little *too* harsh, but I think I understand, at least, as much as my one year of experience working as a developer allow me to

Was when I read about the position that I started questioning myself, _what did I built in this past time?_, I mean, professionally in my work, a lot of things! NDA covered
things,
so that wouldn't do

I had to go back and search in previous work, not ideas, not prototypes, actual stuff that I have built, so I went back to my portfolio.

### Diff

Before continuing with this history, take into deep consideration that the most recent change to my portfolio was made right before I get an actual job, 1 year ago, so, revisiting
it 1 fast-paced-environment year after that, is as fun as embarrassing. But I'm pretty confident of that mixture of feelings to be a proof of my progress through this last year.

1. **Migrate from Yarn to npm:** I would love to go back time and capture the exact moment in which I decided to use Yarn, like, not event taking into account that npm exists, just
   why Yarn. Jokes aside, I felt like it would be a small but fun change to get back to speed with the project.
2. **Set up a nice eslint configuration file:**
3. **Add markdown support:** So, I would need a blog to create this that you are reading right now, in the past I did it manually

# Open source contributions

In the job offer is recommended to add open source contributions, I didn't have any memorable or useful ones... until now! the last commits to
the [portfolio repo](https://github.com/ignfer/portfolio) show improvements made to the project, and I think is usable, at least for a bit, to show my current quality as a dev.

### Missing tasks

I wasn't able to complete these tasks before the application ended so I would be working on them during april

- [ ] Add react router

### Final notes

I know is not the most serious blog post entry, it never was the plan, the idea was to be genuine, to give an insight of how is a common day working with me, independently of the
result, the end result and change made within myself was

To whoever is reading this, have a nice day! ðŸ«¡
