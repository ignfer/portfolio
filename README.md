# Personal Web Portfolio

* Aiming to go beyond a traditional resume or portfolio, the main goal was to establish a digital hub which provides a centralized space where interested people like recruiters or colleagues, can explore my previous works, educational background, and recommendations from professionals I have collaborated with. So, I felt that the idea was a valuable project to settle and display my learning and control over React.

* The site creates a connection point in which you could see a more meaningful description or examples of my experience, given that we live in a fast-pace world I preferred a more dashboard approach, making all the info easily accesible and with no long transitions or scroll animations.

* The project is currently deployed on GitHub pages and was created with the Vite framework, It took me 6 months of developing on my free time after work or after college for the 0.0.1 version to be up and running and during those 6 months I came up with a Figma design and started the implementation from scratch and using vanilla CSS for the styles and the responsiveness. I improved my CSS skills creating a very modern and serious design with a consistent style and my own personal touch on every detail.

* In the future I am planning on adding a mark down component to make my life easier when adding new info, also I am working on a blog and a tech stack section, both will add to the main goal of creating a place to present my whole journey as a developer. Additionally I would like to introduce a Spanish translation and a light theme option relying on the react useContext hook.
